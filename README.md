This repository contains the code for parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR). 

Data from multiple laser-induced cavitation experiments in a common soft hydrogel or liquid is post-processed collectively to inversely calibrate a finite deformation viscoelastic model for the characterized material. According to input values of (a) maximum bubble radius, (b) maximum stretch ratio, and (c) collapse time, we seek to minimize a cost function within the space of trial viscoelastic parameters. The cost function describes the agreement between the experimentally measured bubble collapse time $t_{\rm c}^{\rm Expt}$ and a theoretical prediction $t_{c}^{EB}$ corresponding to a set of viscoelastic parameters.
